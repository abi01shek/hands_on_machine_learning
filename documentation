Chapter 2 end to end machine learning project
steps
1. look at big picture
2. get data
3. discover and visualize data to gain insights
4. prepare data for machine learning algorithms
5. select a model and train it
6. fine tune your model
7. present your solution
8. launch monitor and maintain your system

Preformance measure
RMSE - root mean squared error - L2 norm, euclidian norm
MAE - mean absolute error - L1 norm, manhattan norm
Lk norm (|v0|^k + |v1|^k + .. |Vn|^k)^1/k = ||vk||
L0 - number of non zero elements in vector
Linfinity - maximum absolute value in vector
higher norm index, more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones. RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than MAE but performs well on bell-shaped curves and is prefered

Creating virutal environment
pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv
virtualenv env
cd ~/Work/Learning/Tensorflow/hands_on_machine_learning/chap_2_end_to_end_mc_project
source env/bin/activate

Creating test set
random sampling is fine if dataset is huge, if dataset is small it can create sampling bias.
Stratified sampling - population is divided into strata (male, female) and right number of instances is sampled from the stratum to guarantee test set is representative of whole population

Next step - Visualizing the data
